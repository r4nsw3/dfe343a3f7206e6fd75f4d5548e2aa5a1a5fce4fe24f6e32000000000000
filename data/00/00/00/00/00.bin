  |   Become a psychic "Harrior" and fight against the demons that          |
  |   appeared in Dragonland, the origin of a 3D shooting game. Shoot       |
  |   down the demons that appear one after another on the horizon with     |
  |   "Supernatural Cannon". In the battle of all 18 stages, strange and    |
  |   attractive enemies such as evil dragons, first eye mammoths, and      |
  |   near-future fighters will appear one after another. Of course,        |
  |   there is also a bonus stage on the back of the justice dragon         |
  |   "Euriah".                                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The ultimate ported version that has further evolved from the         |
  |   Nintendo 3DS version.                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The powerful version of the arcade version is as it is, and the       |
  |   additional elements in the Nintendo 3DS version are also included,    |
  |   such as wide screen support and the addition of the final boss        |
  |   "Hayao" for home use. It also includes wallpaper that simulates the   |
  |   atmosphere of the arcade enclosure and a screen display of CRT-style  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In addition, a new game mode "Komainu Barrier Attack" has been        |
  |   added.                                                                |
  |   With strong friends, you can play comfortably even if you are not     |
  |   good at Space Harrier.                                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * This new version captures the spirit of the original 1985 arcade    |
  |     version while also adding in features from the 2012 3DS title       |
  |     such as widescreen support and the console-exclusive final boss.    |
  |     There's also a special wallpaper and CRT display (see below),       |
  |     channelling the retro glory of the arcade era                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * The new mode "Komainu Barrier Attack" allows you to befriend        |
  |     powerful allies in battle - making the aerial dog fights in the     |
  |     game much easier for less skilled players. Komainu provides you     |
  |     with a special barrier, meaning you can make contact with enemies   |
  |     and obstacles without taking damage                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * The last notable feature in this updated version of Space Harrier   |
  |     is the special "Joystick Mode" allowing you to hold your Joy-Con    |
  |     vertically and recreate the controls of the original arcade game    |
  |                                                                         |
